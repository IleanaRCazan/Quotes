[On Team Effectivness at Google](https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/5721312655835136) "The researchers found that what really mattered was less about who is on the team, and more about how the team worked together."

> When cognitive load isn’t considered, teams are spread thin trying to cover an excessive amount of responsibilities and domains. Such a team lacks bandwidth to pursue mastery of their trade and struggles with the costs of switching contexts.

> Instead of choosing between a monolithic architecture or a microservices architecture, design the software to fit the maximum team cognitive load.
